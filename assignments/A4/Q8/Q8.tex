\section*{Question 8:}
Exercise 9.11:
The K nearest neighbors of a document could be represented by links to those documents. Describe two ways this representation could be used in a search application.

\subsection*{Answer:}

One way this representation could be used in a search application is by having a section for documents that are related to the results in which the neighbors of a result could be listed. This could be beneficial if the assumption that related pages link to each other is true.

A second way this representation could be useful is for narrowing down the search results. The user could choose to search in a particular cluster after getting results from different clusters.
