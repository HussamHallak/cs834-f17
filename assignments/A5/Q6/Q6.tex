\section*{Question 6:}
Extra Credit: SVMlight, 10 points extra credit:
see: http://www.cs.cornell.edu/People/tj/svm\_light/
* 1 point:
work through the "Inductive SVM" example, discuss in detail the steps and resulting output
* 9 points: 
- create your own example modeled after the "Inductive SVM" example
- pick a topic (e.g., "Australia") and provide 100 positive and 100 negative examples for training data:
  -- using the Reuters-21578 collection (linked from the SVMlight page)
  -- or, create your own collection with crawled web pages 
- pick 30 documents not in the training set for your test data
- stem the words in the collection, using TFIDF as the features (compute for the 230 documents)
- train, classify, and discuss the results

\subsection*{Answer:}

I downloaded and installed the SVM light from: http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/svm\_light/

I followed the installation instructions and downloaded the Inductive SVM example.

I also followed the instructions to run svm\_learn and passed the training data ﬁle train.dat as a command line argument. It  This produced the model ﬁle which I used as an input for the program svm\_classify.

The results were printed on the screen:

Accuracy on test set: 97.67% (586 correct, 14 incorrect, 600 total)

Precision/recall on test set: 96.43%/99.00%

The results show that these scores are very high.

I saved the entire session in the file svm.txt in Q6 folder. Below is the content of the file.
