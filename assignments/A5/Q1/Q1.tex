\section*{Question 1:}
Exercise 10.3: 
Compute five iterations of HITS (see Algorithm 3) and PageRank (see Figure 4.11) on the graph in Figure 10.3. Discuss how the PageRank scores compare to the hub and authority scores produced by HITS

\subsection*{Answer:}

The graph below was copied from the textbook Figure 10.3.

I used the same node numbers in the textbook. The graph below was copied from the textbook Figure 10.4.

I wrote a python script and named it hp.py to calculate HITS and PageRank scores using Link Analysis.

\textbf{Results}

\textbf{Pagerank Algorithm (5 iterations):}


Pagerank values:

1: 0.15415210590313183

2: 0.15415210590313183

3: 0.2151836555953412

4: 0.2730700543561289

5: 0.08952435340504106

6: 0.08952435340504106

7: 0.024393371432183873


\textbf{HITS Algorithm (5 iterations):}


Hubs values:

1: 0.19870751068593528

2: 0.19870751068593528

3: 0.258854060655404

\textbf{Observation:}

Right of the bat, it is clear that hubs and authorities ranking is consistent for all nodes. 

Node 4 placed first in PageRank, but placed fourth in authorities score.

Node 3 placed second in PageRank, but placed first  in authorities score.

Nodes 1 and 2 come after node 3 for both authorities score and PageRank.

Nodes 5 and 6 come after 1 and 2 for both authorities score and PageRank.

There is an obvious difference in ranking for both algorithms, but this could be due to the low number of iterations.
