\section*{Question 5:}
Exercise 11.5:
How many papers dealing with term dependency can you find in the SIGIR proceedings since 2000? List their citations.

\subsection*{Answer:}
To answer this question, I ran the query ``term dependency source:SIGIR'' in Google scholar. 

\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}

The query returned 319 results, however, some of the results are papers dealing with term dependency prior to 2000. I tried to scrape the results page, but I ran into problems and was running out of time. I found a python script that scrapes Google Scholar results page, but the script did not return any results, nor did it return any errors. I abandoned the idea when I realized that I only have one hour to finish this assignment and submit it on time. 

I filtered the results and cleaned them up by hand and saved them in the file sigir2kplus.txt. Below is the content of the file:


\lstinputlisting[breakatwhitespace=(true), breaklines=(true) label=The content of sigir2kplus.txt, caption= The content of sigir2kplus.txt]{Q5/sigir2kplus.txt}
