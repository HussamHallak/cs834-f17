\section*{Question 8:}
Exercise 7.8: Using the Galago implementation of query likelihood, study the impact of short queries and long queries on effectiveness. Do the parameter settings make a difference?

\subsection*{Answer:}

After doing some search for Galago query likelihood, I was able to find some useful information on the wiki pages for Galago on Sourceforge.

Galago uses Latent Dirichlet allocation model, LDA, which is a way of automatically discovering topics that queries contain. 

The impact of short queries and long queries is that short queries can make it difficult to identify which topics they contain because of their ambiguity due to being short.

Long queries should not cause a problem as they will have enough information to determine which topics they contain.
