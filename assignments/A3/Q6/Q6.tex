\section*{Question 6:}
Exercise 7.5: 

Implement a BM25 module for Galago. Show that it works and document
it.

\subsection*{Answer:}

I wrote the code for BM25 in Java since that is the language in which Galago is written. The file is named ``BM25.java''. Some variables should be passed as arguments, but for the purpose of demonstration, I manually set them within the class BM25. Here is the code I wrote:



I downloaded the source code for Galago. BM25 is already implemented in the file ``BM25Scorer.java''. I noticed that IDF is calculated using a different formula. Here is the formula used in their implementation:

\begin{lstlisting}
idf = Math.log(documentCount / (df + 0.5)); 
\end{lstlisting}
