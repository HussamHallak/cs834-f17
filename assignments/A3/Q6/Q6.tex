\section*{Question 6:}
Exercise 7.5: 

Implement a BM25 module for Galago. Show that it works and document
it.

\subsection*{Answer:}

I wrote the code for BM25 in Java since that is the language in which Galago is written. The file is named ``BM25.java''. Some variables should be passed as arguments, but for the purpose of demonstration, I manually set them within the class BM25. Here is the code I wrote:

\lstinputlisting[language=Java, breakatwhitespace=ã€ˆfalse), label=The content of BM25.java, caption= The content of BM25.java]{Q6/BM25.java}

I downloaded the source code for Galago. BM25 is already implemented in the file ``BM25Scorer.java''. I noticed that IDF is calculated using a different formula. Here is the formula used in their implementation:

$idf = Math.log(documentCount / (df + 0.5));$

Below is the code snippet for the constructor method BM25Scorer found in the source file ``BM25Scorer.java''.

\begin{lstlisting}
  public BM25Scorer(NodeParameters parameters) throws IOException {
    b = parameters.get("b", 0.75);
    k = parameters.get("k", 1.2);

    double collectionLength = parameters.getLong("collectionLength");
    documentCount = parameters.getLong("documentCount");
    avgDocLength = (collectionLength + 0.0) / (documentCount + 0.0);

    // now get idf
    long df = parameters.getLong("nodeDocumentCount");
    // I'm not convinced this is the correct idf formulation -- MAC
    //idf = Math.log((documentCount - df + 0.5) / (df + 0.5));
    
    idf = Math.log(documentCount / (df + 0.5));
  }
\end{lstlisting}
