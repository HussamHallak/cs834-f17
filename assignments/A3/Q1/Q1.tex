\section*{Question 1:}
Exercise 6.2: 

Create a simple spelling corrector based on the noisy channel model. Use a single-word language model, and an error model where all errors with the same edit distance have the same probability. Only consider edit distances of 1 or 2. Implement your own edit distance calculator (example code can easily be found on the Web).
